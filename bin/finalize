#
# The finalize script prepares the app for launch and runs only for the last buildpack.
# All output sent to STDOUT is relayed to the user through the cf CLI.
#
# The script is run with four arguments:
#
# - The build directory for the app
# - The cache directory, which is a location the buildpack can use to store assets during the build process
# - The deps directory, which is where dependencies provided by all buildpacks are installed
# - The index, which is a number that represents the ordinal position of the buildpack
#
# The finalize script may find dependencies installed by the supply script of the same buildpack
# in deps/index. It may also look in other directories within deps to find dependencies supplied
# by other buildpacks.
#
# The cache directory provided to the finalize script is preserved even when the buildpack is
# upgraded or otherwise changes. The supply script of the same buildpack also has access to this
# cache directory.
