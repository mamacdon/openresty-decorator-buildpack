#
# The release script provides feedback metadata to CFAR indicating how the app should be executed.
# The script is run with one argument, the build directory. The script must print to standard output
# a Yaml document in the following format:
#
# default_process_types:
#   web: start_command.filetype
#
# `default_process_types` indicates the type of app being run and the command used to start it.
# This start command is used if a start command is not specified in the cf push or in a Procfile.
#
# At this time, only the web type of apps is supported.


# This is not great, since it has to be kept in sync with what the nginx buildpack generates.
# should find a better way
